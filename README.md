Code for my Game Jam project

There was this one-week game jam in the studio that I work. As the sole programmer, this is the code I produced. It's a bit messy, as code in game jams use to be, but it works as intended.

The game is kind of a Tower Defense, where the Player is in a room with a table in the center. This table has a terrain on top and three towers that the player has to defend. Waves of enemies spawn on the other side and the player has to place toys to defend the towers.

In this project, I also worked as game designer.
